### Approach

- Analyzed site HTML to identify optimal tags and classes for data extraction 
- Wrote script with BeautifulSoup to parse content and extract job titles, companies, locations
- Filtered data to retrieve only Python developer roles 
- Output filtered job data to a structured CSV file
- Used time delays between requests to avoid overloading the site


### Solution Highlights

- Extracted and structured relevant job listing data 
- Filtered and output Python developer roles
- Wrote clean, structured data to CSV format
- Demonstrates web scraping for business intelligence needs
- Scalable code to add fields or scrape additional pages

Overall, this project shows proficiency in using Python for practical web scraping and data extraction purposes. The techniques used highlight core skills like parsing, extracting, filtering, and structuring unstructured web data.
